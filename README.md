#### I have been trying to estimate how many stiches there are in a row and this is what I have guessed (I might count later on):
200 stiches per row
800 stiches per hour

A new stich every 4.5 seconds non stop for 1 hour.

### Hour 4.5

Only did half an hour here as I had other comittments. 2.5 hours.
